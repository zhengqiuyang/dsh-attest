# dsh-attest

Signed chain-of-custody for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (dsh) sessions.

Headless agents bypass PR gates entirely; chat UIs show what the agent *said*
it did. This plugin records what the agent actually **did**: every watched
tool result (`bash`, `write`, `edit`, `web_fetch`, …) appends a hash-chained,
ed25519-signed custody record to a durable JSONL ledger. Tamper with any line
and the chain breaks; delete the tail and it no longer matches the published
head. Zero LLM calls in the trust path.

Family: **dsh-read-guard** guards what the agent reads, **dsh-pr-gate** gates
what it writes, **dsh-attest** proves what it did.

## Why now (checked 2026-10-12)

Nothing in the dsh plugin ecosystem produces tamper-evident records of agent
activity. The nearest neighbours inventory plugins (`dsh-harbor`, 24★ — a
read-only list of what's *installed*) or add LLM-based reviewing. The
in-toto-shaped lane — signed, verifiable, CI-consumable evidence of what an
agent session did — is empty. The signing core is vendored from
[agent-attest](https://github.com/zhengqiuyang/agent-attest), whose CI gate
can consume this ledger as session-side evidence.

## How it works

```
tool result ──> custody record {time, tool, callId, isError, sha256(content)}
            ──> chained: digest = sha256(canonicalJSON({seq, prevDigest, record}))
            ──> signed: ed25519 over the digest (keypair in .dsh-attest/keys/)
            ──> appended: .dsh-attest/session.jsonl (one line, strict order)
```

Verification is pure and offline: replay the ledger, recompute every digest,
check every link and signature. Publish the head digest (or the public key)
anywhere durable — a PR description, a CI variable — and any later comparison
detects tampering or truncation deterministically.

A keypair is generated on first run; the private half never leaves the
machine running the agent. `sign: false` runs a digest-only chain if you only
need tamper-evidence against a published head.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile default add github:zhengqiuyang/dsh-attest
```

git installs build from source; authorize the build once in the profile's
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  dsh-attest: true
```

## Configure

```yaml
- id: dsh-attest
  name: dsh-attest
  config:
    tools: [bash, write, edit, str_replace_editor, web_fetch]
    ledgerPath: .dsh-attest/session.jsonl
    keysDir: .dsh-attest/keys
    sign: true
```

Add `.dsh-attest/` to your repository's `.gitignore` — the private key must
never be committed; the public key is what a verifier checks.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm test   # syncs the vendored agent-attest core, builds, runs unit tests
```

The canonical-JSON serializer and ed25519 PEM helpers are vendored from the
sibling `agent-attest` checkout (`npm run sync`; CI runs `sync --check`).

## Roadmap

- Session-end in-toto statement envelope (full interop with agent-attest CI)
- Per-session ledgers keyed by session id
- A `verify` tool card: replay + verdict inside the Web UI
- GitHub check-run bridge: head digest posted to the PR

## Kill criteria

If dsh ships first-party signed session records, or a major plugin-adds
attestation natively, this freezes at its last working version with a
postmortem here. The signing core stays owned by agent-attest either way.
